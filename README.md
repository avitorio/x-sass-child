# X Theme Child with Sass, Gulp and Browsersync

I've been working with the X Theme for a lot of my clients and decided to upgrade their vanilla child theme with Sass, Gulp and Browsersync for faster development.

## Prerequisites:
* NPM
* Gulp
* Browsersync

## Usage:
1. Download the repository.
2. Place it inside your /wp-content/themes/ folder.
3. Run "npm install" from the terminal.
4. Once installation is completed run "gulp watch".

## Files to edit:

Sass files:
```
/sass/theme/_child_theme.scss
/sass/theme/_child_theme_variables.scss
```
Javascript files:
```
/src/js/custom.js
```
